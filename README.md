# README

This project requires a custom WebGL template to remove the fullscreen button.

The NoFullscreen template can be located in the BuildTemplate directory in the root of the repo but must be copied to the Unity installation directory to be able to be found by Unity.

The location to copy the folder to may differ: ```C:\Program Files\UnityInstalls\2021.3.13f1\Editor\Data\PlaybackEngines\WebGLSupport\BuildTools\WebGLTemplates```.

You may need to select the template in the Player settings.
